\section{Education}

\begin{CV}
\item[2002--2008] Ph.D. in Computer Systems Engineering at Blekinge Institute of Technology,
  Sweden.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Research on SMP operating system porting and binary translation.
  \item Research member of the Parallel Architecture and Applications for
    Real-Time systems group.
  \end{itemize}

\item[1998--2002] MA of Computer Science, Lund University, Sweden.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Specialization: Operating systems, compiler construction.
  \end{itemize}

\item[1996--2000] BA of Human Geography, Lund University, Sweden.

\end{CV}

\section{Work experience}

\begin{CV}
\item[2009--] Net Insight AB, Sweden
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Design and implementation of C++17 code in a distributed system, from FPGA 
      register accesses up to the CLI and web support interface
    \item Test-driven development with a heavy focus on unit testing
    \item Control software for 100Gb Ethernet- and terabit-scale DTM switches
    \item IP encapsulation for video feeds (SMPTE 2110, 2022-6)
    \item Design and DPDK driver of a custom high-performance network interface
    \item Linux kernel driver for the same network interface
  \end{itemize}
Keywords: git, C++17, unit testing, Python, DPDK, kernel drivers, Ethernet

\item[2006--2009] Ericsson AB, Sweden

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Adaptation of the Linux kernel for custom Freescale PowerPC-based
    switch boards as well as kernel drivers for specialized hardware
  \item A Linux-based root filesystem and basic userland (``distribution'')
  \end{itemize}
Keywords: C, kernel drivers

\item[Fall 2002--2008] Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Implementor of SMP support for the Dicos operating system
    kernel in the Ericsson TSP system on Intel IA-32 hardware.
  \item Implementor of the Cibyl binary translator and programming environment
    for C/C++ support in a J2ME environment, including aggresive optimizations
    and GDB support
  \item Lecturing and assisting undergraduate students in low-level
    programming (MIPS and Intel IA-32 assembly) and game programming courses.
  \end{itemize}
Keywords: research, assembly language, operating systems

\item[Summer 2001, spring 2002] University of Karlsruhe, Germany.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Research student the Systems Architecture group, system-level work
    with the L4Ka::Hazelnut microkernel.
  \item As MSc. thesis, a device driver framework for the Prime multiserver
    operating system was designed and implemented. The device driver framework
    handles virtual to physical address translation through a hierarchy of
    memory servers as well as time-limited memory pinning for DMA.
  \item The Qt/Embedded library was ported to run directly on top of the
    L4Ka::Hazelnut kernel, with a minimal libc implemented and drivers for
    SVGA graphics and terminal input.
  \end{itemize}
Keywords: operating systems, kernel drivers


\item[Summers 2000, 2002] Axis communications, Lund, Sweden.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Monitoring extensions, bug fixes and test programs for the Linux journalling
    flash file system (JFFS) was implemented.
  \item A presentation tool which displays and selects interesting video feeds
    from multiple network cameras in realtime was implemented.
  \end{itemize}

\item[Other] Participation in open source projects (https://github.com/SimonKagstrom)

During the years, I've written and contributed to a lot of open source software, most
of which is available on my github account. Some highlights are:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Implementor of Kcov, a code coverage tool similar to gcov
      which instruments binaries and tests coverage without compiler
      options.
    \item Designer and imlpementor of the Cibyl programming environment, a
      binary translator MIPS-Java bytecode which allows C/C++ programs
      to run on J2ME-capable mobile phones. Using this, I was the first person
      on Earth to finish Space Quest on a mobile phone.
    \item Implementor of EmilPRO and Dissy, two versions of graphical disassemblers for
      multiple architectures in Qt and GTK.
  \end{itemize}
